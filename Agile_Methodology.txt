Agile:
Agile is an iterative way of managing projects and developing software that 
makes it easier for teams to deliver value to their customers more quickly and effectively.

As a result of continuously evaluating requirements, plans, and results, 
teams are able to respond to change in a timely manner.

Agileâ€™s four main values are:

    -Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    -Working software over comprehensive documentation
    -Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    -Responding to change over following a plan

Scrum: Principle-based project management
Kanban: Visual workflows and processes
Scrumban: Hybrid of Scrum and Kanban
Extreme Programming XP: Customer-focused product development
Adaptive Project Framework APF: Versatile teamwork

Agile Methodology

1. Extreme Programming
    -Framework to create high-quality software
    -applicable while handling changing software requirements risks caused due to new software

2. Kanban
    -enables organizations to visualize their flow of work and limit the amount of work in progress.
    -used in situations where work arrives unpredictably, and where it needs to be deployed 
     immediately without waiting for other work items. 

     Todo => in progress = > completed

    -Ideal for continuous delivery
    -Supports continuous delivery
    -Less focus on roles and events
    -Focus on workflow rather that sprints

3. Lean
    -It is a set of tools and principles that focuses on identifying and
    removing waste to speed up process development.
    -Value is maximized, and waste is minimized.
